		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<h2>TO THE BIRTHDAY TESTING INITIATIVE</h2>
		<p>The following series of puzzles were published on February 17, 2017 in celebration of a birthday.
			This is an evaluation that will assess the bounds of your cognitive ability.
			You are encouraged to use search engines and resources in order to solve the problems given.
			Reading the source code is not required, and highly discouraged.
		</br></br>
			Each puzzle will require you to obtain a single keyword, to be typed into the password box in order to progress.
			Obtained keywords are not case sensitive, and will not require any spaces or additional fluff.
			For example, if you wish to answer the question "What is the common animal that chases its tail, barks at mailmen, and loves bones?", you would enter "dog" or "Dog" instead of "a dog".
		</br></br>
		If you ever find yourself challenged beyond the scope of your ability or you think this puzzle is dumb, simply click the hint button in the lower right for a clue. You may try it now as an example.
		</br></br>
		Your ultimate objective is to obtain a final password that will be entered <a href="final.html">here</a>. The first letter of each password you obtain will spell a final keyword. The 'welcome' password you just typed does not count.
		</br></br>
		When you are ready, please continue to the next page, and the test will commence.
